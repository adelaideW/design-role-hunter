// ─── MOCK INTERVIEW ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a senior design interviewer conducting a live design challenge session. You are warm but professional, and your goal is to evaluate the candidate's design thinking process — not just their final output.

You will:
1. Start by presenting ONE clear design challenge prompt (keep it realistic, like something from a fintech, SaaS, or consumer app company). Pick from variety: redesign a flow, design a new feature, solve a specific user problem.
2. Wait for the candidate to respond. Evaluate whether they ask clarifying questions before diving in.
3. Answer their clarifying questions thoughtfully, like a real PM or lead designer would.
4. When they start presenting ideas, probe them with follow-up questions like:
   - "Why did you make that choice?"
   - "What would a user who's less tech-savvy think of that?"
   - "How does this connect to the business goal?"
   - "What would you cut if you only had time for one thing?"
5. Push back on at least one decision to test how they handle critique. Don't be harsh — be curious.
6. After they've presented their solution, give honest, specific feedback on:
   - Their process (did they clarify before designing?)
   - Their communication (did they narrate their thinking?)
   - Their design rationale (did they connect decisions to user/business goals?)
   - How they handled pushback
   - One key thing to improve

Keep responses concise. One message at a time. Never give the full challenge and all instructions at once — let it unfold naturally like a real interview.

Start by briefly introducing yourself and presenting the design challenge. Be direct and realistic.`;

  "Design an empty state for a new user's dashboard on a financial analytics platform.",

      default: "Good question. The current flow has 6 steps: account creation, company details, connecting a bank account, inviting team members, setting up a chart of accounts, and a tutorial. Most users drop off at bank connection.",
      where: "Most users drop off at step 3 — connecting a bank account. It requires OAuth authentication and users seem to hesitate or not have credentials ready.",
      who: "Primary users are small business owners (non-technical) and their accountants. They're often setting this up together remotely.",
      why: "We think it's a combination of trust issues (sharing bank credentials feels scary) and timing — they're not ready to do it during initial signup.",
      how: "We currently have a linear, mandatory flow. There's no way to skip or come back to steps later.",
      metric: "Our goal is to get 80% of users to complete setup within 7 days of signup.",

      "What would a 55-year-old accountant who's not very tech-savvy think of that flow?",
      "How does skipping steps connect to the business goal of getting users fully set up?",

    pushback: "I hear you on making the bank connection optional — but our data shows users who skip it have a 3x lower retention rate at 30 days. Doesn't that undermine the whole point of onboarding?",
    pushbackFollowup: "That's a fair response. How would you measure success for your redesign — what's the metric you'd watch first?",
    feedback: `Here's my honest feedback on this session:

**Process** — You asked clarifying questions before jumping in, which is exactly right. You understood the drop-off point and the user context before proposing solutions.

**Communication** — You narrated your thinking clearly. I could follow your reasoning even when I pushed back.

**Design rationale** — Your decisions connected to real user behavior (the bank connection hesitation). You grounded your ideas in the context I gave you.

**Handling pushback** — You held your ground with data reasoning rather than folding immediately. That's a good instinct — just make sure you're also genuinely listening and updating your view when the pushback reveals something you missed.

**One key thing to improve** — Go deeper on edge cases during the session. What happens to a user who skips every optional step? What does their account look like on day 2? Interviewers look for that kind of forward-thinking.`,

    pushbackFollowup: "Good — so placement and timing are your bet. How would you validate that hypothesis quickly before we invest in building it?",
    feedback: `Here's my feedback on this session:

**Process** — Strong start. You asked about the data we have available before designing, which is smart — the solution only works if the data supports it.

**Communication** — You explained your reasoning well. When I pushed back you didn't just restate your idea — you identified the specific variable (placement vs. content) that you were betting on.

**Design rationale** — Your decisions connected to the emotional state of the user (stressed, looking backward). That's good empathy work.

**Handling pushback** — You took the pushback seriously and turned it into a testable hypothesis. That's exactly the right move.

**One key thing to improve** — Push yourself to be more specific about the visual. "An insight card" is a concept, not a design. What does it look like? What's the copy? How many words? Sketching even verbally ("imagine a white card with the merchant logo, one bold number, and two lines of explanation") would make your ideas much more concrete and memorable to an interviewer.`,

    pushbackFollowup: "So you're proposing a two-tier approach. How do you prevent the passive suggestion from feeling like a notification that gets ignored — or worse, creates anxiety?",
    feedback: `Here's my feedback on this session:

**Process** — Excellent. You immediately identified the core tension (AI helpfulness vs. workflow disruption) and asked who the user is before proposing surfaces. That's senior-level thinking.

**Communication** — Very clear. You used concrete examples (command palette, sidebar) and defined your terms ("non-intrusive" is vague without a definition — you handled the follow-up well).

**Design rationale** — Connecting your surface choice to user behavior (keyboard-driven, interruption-averse) was strong. You designed for the actual person, not the average person.

**Handling pushback** — When I pointed out the 20% command palette usage, you adapted quickly. You didn't abandon your idea — you extended it. That's good judgment.

**One key thing to improve** — Think about the AI being wrong. You touched on it briefly but the failure state is just as important as the success state. What happens when the AI assigns the wrong person? How does the user correct it without friction? Interviewers at AI-first companies will always probe this.`,

    pushbackFollowup: "So tiers as defaults, with granular control underneath. That's a reasonable compromise. How do you surface that granular layer without making it feel like a dark pattern — like we're hiding it?",
    feedback: `Here's my feedback on this session:

**Process** — You asked the right questions: who the users are, why they're opting out, what 'success' means. You didn't assume the solution before understanding the problem.

**Communication** — Clear and structured. You explained the trade-offs in your tiered approach honestly, which is exactly what a real interviewer wants to see.

**Design rationale** — Your insight that 'all or nothing' is the root problem — not the quantity of notifications — was sharp. You reframed the problem well.

**Handling pushback** — You engaged with the paternalism concern seriously rather than dismissing it. You found a middle path (tiers as defaults + granular escape hatch) without abandoning the core idea.

**One key thing to improve** — Spend more time on the onboarding moment. When does a user first set these preferences? At signup? First notification? A prompt after their third week? The timing of consent and defaults matters enormously for a feature like this, and it's often what distinguishes a thoughtful designer from one who just solved the surface problem.`,

    feedback: `Here's my feedback on this session:

**Process** — You asked about available assets (sample data, templates) before designing, which is practically-minded and shows maturity. You also correctly identified the emotional problem — intimidation — not just the functional one.

**Communication** — Good. You articulated the sample data rationale clearly, and when I pushed back on the deception risk, you had a specific answer ready (persistent labeling).

**Design rationale** — Connecting sample data to 'time-to-first-value' was well-reasoned. You understood that the goal is engagement, not just aesthetics.

**Handling pushback** — You took the concern seriously without abandoning your approach. You identified the specific design decision (CTA prominence) that would determine whether your solution works.

**One key thing to improve** — Think about the transition moment more carefully. The most critical UX in your design isn't the empty state — it's the moment a user switches from sample data to their own data. What does that handoff look like? Is it one click? Does their first real dashboard look as good as the sample? That transition is where the design either delivers on its promise or breaks trust.`,
